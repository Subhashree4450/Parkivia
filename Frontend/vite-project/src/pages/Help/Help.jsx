          <p>To access the Parkivia dashboard, open the application to view real-time parking availability and the current status. To generate your QR code, enter your vehicle number at the entry gate, and a unique QR code will be generated instantly, which you must show at the entry point to register your session. When exiting, proceed to the exit gate, scan your QR code, and the system will automatically calculate your parking fee based on the duration of your stay.</p>
